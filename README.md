# Meeto Client

A web interface built in React for interacting with the [Meeto API](https://github.com/Kynosaur/meeto).
This app is designed for travellers looking to group together with others, for the purpose of having cheaper fares and/or safety in numbers.
Users can view the list of trips, and add their own by entering the to/from locations and their contact details.
